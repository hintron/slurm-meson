Building Comments

My task is to investigate why Autotool building output has increased space recently.

Thoughts
=============

I noticed that there are Makefile.am's that have srun_LDADD = $(LIB_SLURM) (i.e. libslurm) and srun_DEPENDENCIES = $(LIB_SLURM_BUILD) (i.e. libslurmfull). Does this mean that both are being linked in?

Is it possible that libslurm is still being statically built in every folder, even
though it's supposed to be dynamically linked in?
