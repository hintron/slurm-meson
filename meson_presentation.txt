Meson
========
Pros
--------
+ Fast build times with Ninja
    * https://mesonbuild.com/Performance-comparison.html
    * 'empty build' or 'nothing needed' build times are instantaneous
+ Can do everything that Autotools can (as far as I can tell)
+ Easier maintenance due to simplicity and explicitness
    * Python-like simple syntax
    * Easy to use
+ Well documented
+ Open Source
+ Actively developed
+ Guides to port from Autotools to Meson
    * https://mesonbuild.com/Porting-from-autotools.html#porting-from-autotools
    * https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/GnomeGoals/MesonPorting
+ Backed by GNOME
    * Will be or currently is used by all GNOME projects
+ It's a joy to use compared to Autotools
+ Native support for modern tools (coverage, Valgrind, static analyzers)
+ Does not use Make or shell scripts
    * It can still call external scripts and programs if needed


Cons
--------
- Relatively new
- Does not yet have a very large user base
- Unfamiliar to the team; yet another thing to learn
- Because of active development, meson OS packages are old
- Requires python3, pip3, and installing meson via pip3
- Slightly different command line syntax to build and configure a project
- Mainly developed by one guy, with only a small supplementary development team
    * If that guy disappears, then there could be a support problem

Autotools
===========
Pros
--------
+ Stable
+ De facto standard - Used by many people
+ Understood by a lot of people
+ Understood(?) by our team
+ Can do everything

Cons
--------
- Difficult to understand
    * Harder to maintain build scripts
    * Easier to introduce bugs and errors
    * Harder to track down build/link bugs
- Slower
    * Reduces programmer productivity waiting for builds
- Relies on shell scripts and Make
- Possibly not as portable to Windows



Conclusion
===========
I believe that moving to Meson will reduce our technical debt.
It will save debugging time when we have issues figuring out random linking errors.
It will also save developer time with the faster build times.
Maintaining and editing the build scripts will also be easier and less error-prone.
